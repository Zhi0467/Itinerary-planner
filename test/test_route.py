"""
This module contains unit tests for the route planning logic in `routes.py`.

Tests:
- test_simple_route: Verifies that the planner produces a valid route given 
  a set of tasks and a time budget.
- Additional tests for edge cases (e.g., invalid input or no feasible route) 
  should be added here.

Usage:
Run this script with a testing framework (e.g., unittest) to validate the 
correctness of the route planner.
